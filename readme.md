# Visual Studio Code Integration with NI Software

This tutorial series demonstrates various use cases for integrating Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with NI Software. Whether used as a text editor or a development environment, VS Code enhances the way you analyze log files, configuration files, and data files. It also enables you to create code that can be seamlessly integrated with tools like LabVIEW and TestStand. Additionally, you can leverage NI APIs, such as the TestStand API, to build stand-alone applications.
